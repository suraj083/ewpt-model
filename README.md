# ewpt-model

A python package aimed at constructing temperature dependent Lagrangians that can model first order phase transitions in the context of electroweak physics.

Models such as the Standard Model (SM), Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and extensions of the SM through the addition of a real or complex $SU(2)$ $n$-plet scalar can be incorporated.

Differential equations encapsulating bubble dynamics can be solved with the help of [Elvet](https://elvet.gitlab.io/elvet/).
